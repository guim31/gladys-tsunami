# Tsunami Alerts (NOAA)

The official tsunami messages of NOAA's two tsunami warning centers, for the
coast of your home, in Gladys: the level in effect (information statement,
advisory, watch, warning), the earthquake behind it, and the estimated arrival
time of the first wave when the bulletin gives one.

> **This is not an official alert service.** It reads public bulletins once a
> minute and can be late, wrong or silent (network, tsunami.gov, Gladys). It
> does not replace tsunami sirens, Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) on your
> phone, NOAA Weather Radio or the instructions of your local authorities. If
> you feel a strong earthquake near the coast, move to high ground at once:
> do not wait for any message. Not affiliated with NOAA.

## What you get

- One device, **Tsunami alert**, for the followed region:
  - **Tsunami alert level** (risk level): 0 no threat, 1 advisory, 2 watch or
    international threat message, 3 warning;
  - **Message in effect**: the kind of the latest message, or "No message in
    effect";
  - **Earthquake magnitude** and **Earthquake** (place and origin time);
  - **Estimated arrival**: the first wave at the forecast point nearest to your
    home (300 km at most), when the bulletin lists arrival times.
- A scene trigger for every new bulletin of your region, a scene action that
  reads the message in effect as one sentence, and a dashboard widget.

## Requirements

- Gladys Assistant 5.1 or later.
- Internet access from Gladys to `www.tsunami.gov` (HTTPS). No account, no key.
- The location of your house set in Gladys, or coordinates in the
  configuration, or a region chosen by hand.

## Configuration

1. Install the integration (Integrations → Install from GitHub,
   `https://github.com/guim31/gladys-tsunami`).
2. Open its configuration, check the settings below and save.
3. In the **Discover** tab, create the **Tsunami alert** device.

### Settings

- **Followed region**: _Automatic_ deduces it from your home. Choose it by hand
  when your coast is near a border between two regions, or outside them.
  - Alaska, British Columbia and the US West Coast (NTWC);
  - US East and Gulf coasts, eastern Canada (NTWC);
  - Hawaii; Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands; American Samoa; Puerto
    Rico and the Virgin Islands (PTWC);
  - Caribbean and Pacific, international messages (PTWC): the threat messages
    the PTWC writes for the national authorities of every country of the basin
    (French West Indies, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Japan, Chile…).
- **Home latitude / longitude**: leave both empty to use your house in Gladys.
  A decimal comma is accepted.
- **Refresh interval**: 1, 2 or 5 minutes.
- **Language of the texts**: names of the device and features (at their
  creation) and texts sent to the scenes.

## Levels and messages

| Message (NOAA)                 | Level | Meaning                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| No message, information        | 0     | No threat for your region, or nothing in effect       |
| Advisory                       | 1     | Strong currents and waves: stay out of the water      |
| Watch                          | 2     | A tsunami is possible: be ready to act                |
| Threat message (international) | 2     | Hazardous waves forecast for some coasts of the basin |
| Warning                        | 3     | A dangerous tsunami is possible or expected: evacuate |
| Cancellation or final message  | 0     | The alert is over                                     |

An advisory, a watch, a warning or a threat message stays in effect until the
next bulletin of the region (update, cancellation), or 12 hours without any
bulletin. An information statement or a cancellation is shown until its
expiry (one hour), then "No message in effect".

## Dashboard widget

**Tsunami (NOAA)**: the region, the message in effect coloured by level (green
nothing, blue information, orange advisory, watch or threat, red warning), the
earthquake and the estimated arrival, a button to the bulletin, and the time of
the last reading. Settings: show the earthquake, show the link.

## Scene trigger

**Tsunami: new NOAA message**, filtered by kind of message (information,
advisory, watch, warning, threat, cancellation) and by region. Variables: kind
and region in words, level, magnitude, earthquake location, estimated arrival,
the message in one sentence, and the link to the bulletin.

The bulletins already published when you install the integration, or when the
region changes, fire nothing. For "the level goes up" or "the alert is over",
you can also use the **Tsunami alert level** feature in a device condition.

## Scene action

**Tsunami: read the message in effect**: outputs `text` (one sentence, to send
by message or read aloud), `level` (0 to 3) and `kind` (`none`, `information`,
`advisory`, `watch`, `warning`, `threat`, `cancellation`).

## Scene examples

- Trigger _Tsunami: new NOAA message_, kinds _Watch_ and _Warning_: send the
  `summary` variable by Telegram and turn every light on.
- Trigger _Tsunami: new NOAA message_, kind _Cancellation_: send "Tsunami alert
  over".
- Every day at 8:00, if the level is 1 or more: read the scene action text
  aloud.

## Data sources, terms and quotas

- `https://www.tsunami.gov/events/js/previous.js` (the 40 latest bulletins of
  both centers, one per product) and the Atom feeds `PAAQAtom.xml` (NTWC) and
  `PHEBAtom.xml` (PTWC), read with `If-Modified-Since`: the site answers
  `304 Not Modified` while nothing is issued.
- For each new bulletin of your region, its CAP document and its text
  bulletin (two small files).
- NOAA data are in the public domain; no quota is published. The integration
  sends a User-Agent naming itself, as NOAA asks.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No region"**: set the location of your house in Gladys (Settings →
  Houses), or choose the region by hand.
- **"far from the coasts NOAA covers"**: your home is outside every region;
  choose the closest one by hand if you want its messages.
- **The device stays at "No message in effect"**: that is the normal state;
  use the **Show the message in effect** action to check the last reading.
- More details with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in the logs of the integration.

## Limits

- The region is a whole coast, not your exact zone: a warning for Alaska also
  shows on a home in California. Read the bulletin before acting.
- Arrival times come only from bulletins that list forecast points with
  coordinates (the international threat messages). US warnings give their
  arrival times in words: they are not read.
- The text of the bulletins stays in English (NOAA's words).
- Tested against the real bulletins of tsunami.gov (Panama earthquake of
  9 October 2026, statements of November 2026). No real US warning was issued
  while it was written: the warning, watch, advisory and cancellation cases
  are derived from a real statement. Feedback welcome.
