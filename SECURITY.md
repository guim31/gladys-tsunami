# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report a security problem in a public issue, pull request or
forum post.

Report it privately through GitHub instead: open the **Security** tab of this
repository, then **Report a vulnerability**.

No such button? Private reporting is not enabled yet: open an issue that only
asks the maintainers for a private contact, without any detail of the problem,
and send the report there.

Include, when you can:

- the version of the integration and of Gladys;
- what an attacker can do, and the steps to reproduce it;
- the log lines that help (remove tokens, passwords and addresses first).

The fix ships as a new version of the integration, and the advisory is
published once users can update.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes: update the integration from
Gladys before reporting a problem.

## Scope

In scope: the code of this repository and the Docker image it publishes.

The integration reads public NOAA documents from `https://www.tsunami.gov`,
without account nor key: it holds no secret. It stores in `/data/tsunami.json`
the bulletins already seen and the message in effect for the followed region,
nothing else. The coordinates of the home (configuration or house of Gladys)
are used in the container only, to pick the region and the nearest forecast
point: they are never sent nor logged.

Out of scope: Gladys Assistant itself (see its
[security policy](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys/security/policy)),
and the third-party services the integration talks to (tsunami.gov).
